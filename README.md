## Overview
The occurence of auto accidents have been consistent all through the years and while many of these accidents are attributed to various reasons based on speculations, this analysis focused on the frequency of accidents in Synclair and also know the prominent factors responsible for most accidents.

## Business Questions
- How does the frequency of auto crashes vary by season?
- What is the distribution of auto crashes by weekday?
- Which collision types are most frequently reported in auto crashes?
- How do the prominent collision types correlate with the recorded injuries and number of deaths?
- What are the top 8 locations with the highest auto crash records?
- What are the primary factors causing auto accidents in the top 8 locations?
- What types of injuries are most commonly sustained in auto crashes?
- What is the trend in auto crash incidents over the analyzed period?

## Analysis Findings and Recommendations
- The Accident occurence trend shows that year 2003 has the highest number of auto crash recorded and it got reduced in subsequent years but in the year 2008 slightly below the number recorded in 2003. However, in 2011, the trend shows that there was a notable decline in accident recorded but rose afterwards, I will recommend that whatever measure was put in place in 2011 that reduced the number of accidents recorded can be replicated over the other years.

-  The auto crash incident by seasons shows that the winter season has consistently recorded the highest number of accident and also there is a correlation between the season transitioning and the increase in the accident recorded. From the chart, it is obvious that a larger number of the accidents incidents were primarily caused by the bad weather including the heavy rainfall in autumn and the snow in winter and secondarily by the carelessness of the drivers.
I recommend that citizens should be educated on codes and regulations that needs to be strictly followed in order to ensure safety and reduce the number of accident.

-  The chart also reveals that a greater number of the crash has always been between 2 cars and this has been prominent over the years. Car owners should be more cautioned and sanctioned for recklessness and the chart shows that there has been a hig level of recklessness recorded overtime from drivers making calls while driving alongside the failure to yield to the right of way, this should be curbed

- The trend of crashes on weekdays shows that the highest number of crashes has consistently been on Mondays, this might have been to commuters trying to get to their various places of work on time. I highly recommend that traffic warden should be stationed on the road during the weekdays as the number of accidents recorded on weekdays have consistentky been on the high side over the years.
